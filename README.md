# R6-offsets

Just a little info from the writer: If you have any files which could help or ive said something wrong please dm me.

# Little information about r6:

Rainbow Six Siege is a super popular game and we get many questions about it, most people are begging for Siege Cheats so I thought I would put together an offset thread to at least get people started with this game.

- Game: Rainbow Six Siege
- Developer: Ubisoft
- Engine: AnvilNext 2.0 (Think been updated)
- Anticheat: Battleye

Bio of game from the developer. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter created by by Ubisoft. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on December 1, 2015. The game innovates with environmental destruction and player cooperation. Each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as hostage rescue, bomb defusal and taking control of objectives. The title has no campaign but features a series of short, offline missions called, "situations" that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the "White Masks", a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.

# The battleye anti-cheat system:

offsets. The first thing you should know is that the game uses a popular, and quite effective anticheat software called BattleEye. Many top titles use Battleye including Escape from Tarkov and PUBG. BattleEye is not something inadequate like VAC is, so you'll have to put in some effort, be sure you can bypass it before tackling the goal of finding some rainbow six siege offsets. You won't be doing much hacking online if you don't/can't bypass Battleye. 

he games code has classes that they've defined as "managers" that hold alot of information you will need to use in your hack. Some game hackers have written offset dumpers for rainbow six siege using function signatures. With everything provided in this thread you will be able to build your own hack with rainbow six siege offsets in no time.

The managers that are most commonly used are:

-   GameManager
-   ProfileManager
-   RoundManager(A.K.A. StatusManager)
-   GlowManager(A.K.A. EnvironmentAreaManager)
-   NetworkManager
-   FovManager

These managers are easiest to find with signatures.

# Tools

The best way to find offsets for r6 is by using a Offset dumper. In the tools file you will find a few tools, some may work some may not. P.S if they arn't built they all need to built to a x64

I will add more info soon, im just tired after coding all day. Need help or wanna add? dm me on discord: Soon
